Project Overview
The City Skyline challenge is an exercise to hone your front-end development skills by building a dynamic, animated cityscape. You'll create buildings, skies, and other city elements using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). This challenge emphasizes the following concepts:

Layout with CSS Flexbox or Grid.
Creating shapes and elements with CSS.
Using CSS animations for dynamic effects like twinkling stars or moving clouds.
Responsive design to ensure the skyline looks good on different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structuring the content of the page.
CSS3: Styling the skyline, including colors, positioning, animations, and responsiveness.
CSS Flexbox / Grid
CSS Animations
Gradients and Shadows
Project Structure
The project structure is simple, as it mainly focuses on front-end development:

bash

Features
City Buildings: Various skyscrapers created using simple <div> elements styled with height, width, and background properties.
Sky Background: The background is made using CSS gradients to simulate a day or night sky.
Stars and Moon: Extra celestial elements can be added using CSS shapes or background images.
CSS Animations: Animations such as twinkling stars, moving clouds, or blinking lights in the buildings.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile devices.
